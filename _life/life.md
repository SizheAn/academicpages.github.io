I love traveling, photography, music, gaming, and basketball.(listed in no particular order LOL)

Travel
------
I enjoy living in different regions/countries and traveling all over the world. I was born in an ancient city in China- Xianyang (咸阳). My family moved to a pretty coastal city - Zhuhai, Guangdong (广东珠海) since I was 5. I chose the hometown of Panda - Chengdu (成都) to continue my undergraduate study. I speak fluent Mandarin, Cantonese, Shaanxi, and Sichuan dialects due to these experiences.

During my undergraduate, I was an exchange student at National University of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. In my senior year, I did my and senior graduation project at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia, and National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore.

Coming to the States for post-graduate study, I first joined Arizona State University in Phoenix, AZ. Our whole lab moved to University of Wisconsin-Madison 2 years later. Can you imagine moving from the hottest State to the coldest State? We did it haha and the road trip across the U.S. was spectacular!

This summer (2021), I moved to California for my internship. Love the CA vibe a lot!

Music
